  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
  <div>Dear Eileen,</div>
  <p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer <br>
    your questions one by one, in the following sections.
  </p>
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a <br>
    semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <div>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</div>
  <div>You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.</div>
  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
    by are as follows, in order of priority:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
    <li>
      Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
      audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
    </li>
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
  </p>
  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
    my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
  </p>
  <div>Polynesian chicken dance</div>
  <p>
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>
    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
  </p>
  <div>Icelandic brownian shuffle</div>
  <p>
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
    modern styles such as Twerking.
  </p>
  <div>Arctic robot dance</div>
  <p>
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
    discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
    because they were really cold.
  </p>

  <div>Yours sincerely,</div>
